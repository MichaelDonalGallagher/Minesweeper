Hopefully this is the right type of folder you wanted.
Opening and running these files in unity should work as this 
is how I moved it from the college computers to my home laptop.
If not I'll gladly send it another way.

The only bug I was able to find was that if you put crazy high 
numbers into the custom the recursion bugs out a bit. I believe
it just isnt able to run so many methods at once but it might 
be a problem on my part.

Also my win/loss event is just a bit of text in the compiler.

I also wasn't able to get the camera to be perfectly sized. I 
recall you saying something about the vertical size compared to 
the horizontal but I couldn't find anything online so sometimes
some of the mines are outside the border a slight bit.
